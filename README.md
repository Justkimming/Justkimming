- 👋 Hi, I’m @Justkimming
- 👀 I’m interested in computer hardware, 3D printing, and a little bit of coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying engineering (undetermined which discipline).
      -- I have some experience in:
         Java
         JavaScript
         Python
         Arduino
         Processing 3
